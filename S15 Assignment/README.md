# Session - 15 Assignment (In Progress)

## Requirement

- Train a pre-trained Resnet34 model on CIFAR100 with these hyperparameters:
more than 4+ GPUs
- 4 Epochs
- Use Spot instances
- Record the screen while training, clearly showing spot instance usage, 4 epoch logs, and inferences. 
- Upload the video to youtube (can be unlisted, but not private). 
- Share the link.


## Solution

A comparative study has been done to gauge the cost saving benefits of Spot instances.
The youtube video can be found [here - Will be uploaded in a while](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WgLUYTqaWduVVesIXSS6vl9FiVKG7CI4).
